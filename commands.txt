Build containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml build
Please notice that we are using -f docker-compose-dev.yml - it is to point custom yml file. By default docker-compose is reading yml configuration file from docker-compose.yml (we keep default name for production setting).

Run containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up

Stop containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml down
You can also use Ctrl+C to stop containers if not running in the background.

Build and run containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build
